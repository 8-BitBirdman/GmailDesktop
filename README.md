# Gmail Browser App (PyQt5)

A simple macOS application built with Python and PyQt5 that acts as a dedicated browser for Gmail. This app opens Gmail in a maximized, windowed mode, saves your login session, and provides a focused, distraction-free experience. It also includes a custom app icon for a polished look.

## Features

- Opens Gmail in a standalone, maximized window (without standard browser features like tabs or an address bar).
- Saves login session data (cookies) between launches.
- Customizable with your own app icon.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- `PyQt5` and `PyQtWebEngine` libraries

## Installation

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/gmail-browser-app.git
cd gmail-browser-app
